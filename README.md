# Hackintosh OpenCore on MSI MPG Z490 Gaming Plus

I've successfully installed macOS Catalina and updated to the latest 10.15.7 (19H1519) on my i7-10700K (Comet Lake) running on a MSI MPG Z490 GAMING PLUS (no Wifi) motherboard. I plan to update to Big Sur and Monterey, but *starting* with Catalina tends to be much easier and more stable while working out hardware details like USB mapping.

You can find my `config.plist` in this repository and many notes about current results and my setup process in this document. I carefully followed [Dortania's OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/), [Getting started with ACPI](https://dortania.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/), [Multiboot with OpenCore](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Multiboot/), and [OpenCore Post-Install](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/), and I also had to look up some details in [OpenCore Reference Manual](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/Configuration.pdf). If you're going to build a system like this, you should also read these documents carefully before starting and keep them nearby during the setup process.

## Verified functionality

This is not an exhaustive list. It mostly covers use cases I personally use or care about.

- :white_check_mark: on-board DisplayPort (iGPU, UHD 630)
    - Note: DisplayPort use was *required* during the initial macOS Catalina install.
- :white_check_mark: 3D and video acceleration
    - Verified Safari, Chess, and Maps. Without acceleration, these would crash immediately upon opening.
- :white_check_mark: Built-in stereo line-out sound
    - Available as output device "Internal Speakers".
    - I normally have wired speakers using the rear stereo line-out. Plugging headphone into my case's *front* line-out is *not autodetected*, but they will be detected and start working after a quick sleep/wake cycle.
- :white_check_mark: Built-in line-in/microphone audio
    - Available as input device "Internal Microphone".
- :white_check_mark: Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
    - Verified WiFI using 802.11ac with WPA2.
    - Verified Bluetooth using AirDrop to and from real nearby Macs.
- :white_check_mark: Ethernet (at least gigabit)
    - Verified by connecting directly to another over ethernet computer and testing with `iperf3`.
    - The computer on the other end only supports gigabit ethernet, and the test sufficiently maxed that out. I cannot confirm if the full 2.5 Gbps speed is available.

- :white_check_mark: Sleep and wake from sleep via keyboard/mouse
    - System also wakes up and goes back to sleep periodically for the "Power Nap" setting.
- :white_check_mark: Native NVRAM
    - Verified by clearing with `nvram -c`, setting a value with `nvram`, rebooting, and checking `nvram -p`.
- :white_check_mark: App Store
    - Logged in, searched, downloaded apps, opened downloaded apps from within the App Store app.
- :white_check_mark: iCloud services
    - Messages sending, receiving, and tapback all work normally.
    - Also various services that sync data like Notes, Calendar, etc.
- :white_check_mark: macOS Software Updates
    - Installed all available updates from Apple after the clean install.
    - Automatic rebooting throughout the update install process also works.
- :white_check_mark: Multiboot
    - Verified macOS and Linux on different partitions of the same NVMe and on a separate SATA SSD.
    - Haven't tested with Windows on another partition or drive, but that should work fine too.
- :white_check_mark: Lots of third-party apps working
    - Firefox, mpv, VLC, Adobe Photoshop, Blender, DaVinci Resolve, Handbrake, iTerm2, and many more apps all seem stable.
    - Ditto for numerous command-line programs installed via `brew`.

## Not working, not tested, or unknown

- :grey_question: on-board HDMI
    - I switched to DisplayPort during initial install because the installer image gave only a black screen when using HDMI. I haven't bothered switching back to HDMI after completing the installation.
- :x: Netflix in Safari
    - Native "Fairplay" DRM requires a supported AMD graphics card; I don't have one.
    - Firefox is my primary browser, and it supports Netflix DRM via the proprietary Widevine CMI plugin perfectly fine on the iGPU, as far as I can tell.
- :grey_question: Hibernate
    - Hibernate *probably* works since normal sleep and wake work, but I don't need it for a desktop on a UPS.
- :grey_question: Facetime and Photo Booth
    - Need to get an external video camera to test these, but I suspect they'll work fine.
- :grey_question: Filevault
    - Filevault *probably* works, but I don't have it enabled on this system (yet).
- :grey_question: Apple Music, Apple TV
    - Apple Music *probably* works, but Apple TV *probably doesn't* work since it likely requires hardware Fairplay DRM decoding.
- :grey_question: digital audio out and surround sound
    - Related options appear in System Preferences: Sound: Output, but I don't have the appropriate audio equipment to test.

My custom map removes all ports I couldn't identify, the internal Mystic Light RGB controller, and the USB type C port on the case front.

Here are all the USB ports I could identify in my testing:

## Issues encountered along the journey

Setting up OpenCore and getting to a working macOS desktop is not always an easy paint-by-numbers process. I did a fair bit of experimenting and digging through random forum posts and other people's `EFI` folders to figure out how to get my system to a reliable state. [Dortania's OpenCore Install Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) *and* the related docs are *absolutely critical reading materials*. Be very familiar with the process and technologies involved. Be comfortable working with the command line, restarting many times, checking your work, tweaking configs, rinse, and repeat.

Some specific issues I encountered and resolved include:

- Blank screen when booting the macOS Catalina installer.
    - Resolved by switching from the HDMI port to the DisplayPort one.
- USB ports and devices randomly disconnecting or not working.
    - Resolved by temporarily using `USBInjectAll.kext` with `XhciPortLimit` enabled, following the [USB port-mapping guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/usb/), building the kexts, and reconfiguring with the specific ports I want to keep.
- macOS installer not recognizing a SSD on an internal SATA connector.
    - Resolved by adding `SATA-unsupported.kext`.
- Garbled output or "no entry"/prohibited symbol during boot.
    - This seemed to happen randomly but moderately frequently during my early setup, and I never quite pinned down the exact cause.
    - Since completing the [USB port-mapping guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/usb/) process, though, I have not seen this problem again. macOS's USB port detection may just really *really* bad and unpredictable with this motherboard's ACPI/DSDT.
        <details>
        <summary>Example photo of scrambled/garbled video.</summary>
        <img src="https://github.com/infinitewarp/hackintosh-opencore-msi-z490/blob/main/images/boot-garbage.jpg"/>
        </details>
- Broken video acceleration. Many apps like Safari would immediately crash on open.
    - Resolved by setting `device-id=9B3E0000`.
    - Where does this magic value come from? See the [OpenCore Reference Manual](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/Configuration.pdf) section 6.1. That value (and several related¬†ones) came from `ioreg` output processed by `gfxutil`.
- No audio working on any line-out ports.
    - Resolved by setting `boot-args-alcid=7`. Or maybe `11`. Or maybe `69`. Nice.
    - I stepped through every apparently available ID for my hardware, and these three all seem to function the same way.
    - As mentioned above, this works fine for the rear line-out, but the front line-out is not autodetected when I plug in headphones. Putting the system to sleep and waking it back up triggers whatever hardware refresh is necessary to start using the front line-out again. It's a minor inconvenience, but it's a sufficiently reliable workaround.
    - I tried the `VoohooHDA.kext`, but it wasn't really any better than those options, and Voodoo never seeemed to recognize my front-panel audio ports.
